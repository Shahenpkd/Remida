Remida is a desktop-based chatbot application designed to provide instant first aid and emergency guidance. Built with Python and a modern GUI framework (customtkinter), the chatbot simulates a helpful assistant capable of responding to user-input emergency scenarios such as "burn", "choking", "heart attack", "snake bite", and many more.

The project comprises of two modes. Base Mode and AI mode. The Base mode holds a repository of medical scenarios and responds to users input accordingly. The AI mode uses API to access leading language models which allows for handling more advanced queries.
The main goal of the project is to offer quick, accurate, and actionable first aid responses in critical situations, especially when professional help is not immediately available. It's ideal for general public awareness and can serve as an educational or preparatory tool for emergency readiness.
